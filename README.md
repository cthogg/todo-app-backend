# TODO Backend
- a REST backend for a todo app
- install `npm i`
- run in development via `npm start`

## Design Decisions
- This backend was based on this repository (https://github.com/rwieruch/node-express-server) which I found a very good way to start a node/express application.
- Based on the Zalando REST API guidelines. https://opensource.zalando.com/restful-api-guidelines/
