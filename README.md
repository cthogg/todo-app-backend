# TODO Backend
- a REST backend for a todo app
- This backend was based on this repository which I found a very good way to start a node/express application.
- Based on the Zalando REST API guidelines. https://opensource.zalando.com/restful-api-guidelines/

- POST to create a TODO-  Done
- GET to retrieve a single TODO- Done
